# 🎮🖐️ Interactive Hand-Gesture Based Gaming  

**Interactive Hand-Gesture Based Gaming** is a **computer vision-powered air hockey game** where players control paddles and activate power-ups using **real-time hand gestures** instead of traditional controllers. Built using **Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe**, this project explores how gesture recognition can revolutionize gaming interactions.  

## 🚀 Features  

- 🖐 **Hand-Tracking Based Paddle Control** – Move the paddle using real-time **hand gestures**.  
- ⚡ **Gesture-Activated Power-Ups** – Special moves like a **goal blocker (two fingers up)** and a **central barrier (closed fist)** enhance gameplay.  
- 📸 **Real-Time Hand Detection** – Uses **Mediapipe’s Palm Detection & Hand Landmark Models** for accurate tracking.  
- 🎯 **Intuitive & Interactive Gameplay** – Eliminates the need for controllers, making gaming more accessible.  
- 🖥 **AI-Powered Gesture Recognition** – Powered by **cvzone** for smooth real-time response.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, Mediapipe  
- **Gesture Recognition:** cvzone  
- **Hand Tracking Models:** Mediapipe’s Palm Detection & Hand Landmark Models  

## 🎯 Challenges & Solutions  

- **Lighting Conditions:** Improved detection accuracy by tweaking image preprocessing techniques.  
- **Gesture Misclassification:** Optimized threshold values for better gesture recognition.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Used efficient **bounding box techniques** to reduce lag.
